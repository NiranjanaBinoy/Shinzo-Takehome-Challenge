## Notes

I truly enjoyed working on the challenge. A few questions came up while I was working through the task, but they were all addressed by Duncan very promptly. I really appreciate the support.

The frontend UI is not fully aligned with the provided design. I would have liked to dedicate more time to the project in order to deliver a more polished and accurate UI.

I was able to add comments throughout the code; however, I was not able to include tests or provide detailed documentation for the project.
